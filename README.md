# sigmath-frontend

🔢 Sigmath is a web platform that intends to establish a close connection between computing and mathematics, allowing users to create, share, use and manipulate custom functional mathematical modules to solve real-world problems naturally and automatically in community 🤼.

📝 I completely defined and directed this project and together with a team of 5 people we created a first functional version of the platform developing a REST-API with Node.js and sequelize (postgreSQL), and a Web Application with Vue.js 🌐.
